# Symbolic Computation
Symbolic computation, also known as computer algebra, is a scientific field at the intersection of mathematics and computer science.
- **Definition:** Symbolic computation involves the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and objects symbolically.
- **Numerical vs. Symbolic Computation:** Scientific computing primarily deals with numerical computation using approximate floating point numbers. In contrast, symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables without assigned values, manipulated as symbols.
---

- **Applications:** Symbolic computation finds applications in various domains, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.
- **Integration with Mathematics:** Symbolic computation plays a crucial role in mathematical research, facilitating tasks such as symbolic integration, differentiation, and solving algebraic equations.
- **Advanced Concepts:** Advanced areas of symbolic computation may involve algebraic manipulation, simplification of expressions, and solving complex mathematical problems.
- **Impact:** Symbolic computation tools enhance mathematical exploration, enabling researchers to tackle intricate problems with precision and efficiency.

# Proof Assistants and Automated Proof
Proof assistants and automated proof systems revolutionize mathematical logic and computer science.
- **Type Theory:** Type theory forms the foundation, offering a systematic approach to classifying mathematical objects and relationships.
- **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT):**
HoTT extends type theory, integrating concepts from algebraic topology and enriching the expressive power of proof assistants.
- **Category Theory:** Category theory provides abstract tools for studying mathematical structures and relationships, serving as a unifying framework.
- **Automated Proof:** Automated proof systems leverage algorithms to search for proofs automatically or assist in constructing formal proofs.
- **Impact:** These tools accelerate mathematical discovery and empower researchers to explore complex landscapes with rigor and confidence.
